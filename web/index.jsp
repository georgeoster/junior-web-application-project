With The Grain Co-op recognizes that woodworkers buy other woodworker’s creations as much as regular people.  Perhaps because they are intimately familiar with the process and requisite skill, makers appreciate the fine details of other maker’s pieces in a way that non-makers do not.   Our virtual marketplace allows makers to list their pieces for sale as well as examine pieces from other makers.
