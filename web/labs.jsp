<h2>Lab 1: Web App Proposal and Data Model </h2>
In this lab, I learned how to create a data model to support my web application. Click here for my latest/updated web application proposal (that includes a picture of my data model). 

<h2>Lab 2: Database</h2>
In this lab, I revised my data model then “forward engineered” from my data model to my database. I populated my database with realistic data. I wrote these SQL select statements that demonstrate how to join data from several tables

<h2>Lab 3: JSP Home Page</h2>
In this lab, I made 2 JSP pages. 

<h2>Lab 4: Display Data</h2>
In this lab, I created 3 JSP pages: <a href="./users.jsp">users</a>, <a href="./other.jsp">products</a>, and <a href="./assoc.jsp">purchases</a>.
Each of these pages pulled info from the SQL database.

<h2>Lab 5: Log On</h2>
In this lab, I created 2 JSP pages: <a href ="./logon.jsp">log on</a>, and <a href ="./logoff.jsp">log off</a>.
Additionally, all of my other JSP pages can check if the user is logged on and display log on or log off accordingly.

In this lab, I created 1 JSP page: <a href="./search.jsp">search</a>.  It can be used to search <a href="./assoc.jsp">purchases</a>.

<h2>Lab 7: Insert</h2>
In this lab, I created 3 JSP pages: <a href="./insertOther.jsp">insertOther</a>, <a href="./insertUser.jsp">insertUser</a>, <a href="./insertAssoc.jsp">insertAssoc</a>.  They can be used to insert Customers, Products, or Purchases.

<h2>Lab 8: Update</h2>
In this lab, I altered 3 JSP pages: <a href="./other.jsp">other</a>, <a href="./users.jsp">user</a>, <a href="./assoc.jsp">assoc</a>.  They can be used to update existing Customers, Products, or Purchases.

<h2>Lab 9: Delete</h2>
In this lab, I altered 3 JSP pages: <a href="./other.jsp">other</a>, <a href="./users.jsp">user</a>, <a href="./assoc.jsp">assoc</a>.  They can be used to delete existing Customers, Products, or Purchases.
